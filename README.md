This is my project for the bachelor thesis.
I used JavaFX in it.

This program is for computer analysis photos of metal alloy for subsequent calculation of quantitative characteristics of the microstructure of multicomponent alloys.

The application opens the picture from the disk. We can change the image settings, such as opacity level, sepia tone, scaling factor, hue, saturation, contrast.
Then we can build RGB-histogram or brightness-histogram.

In the second window we can type the limit for extremes and save extremes into csv-file or calculate the required characteristics.
